 Features
************
The Xajax ClassAttributes extension allows you to add class attributes to a content class or 
reorder class attributes without the need of a page refresh. It is especially useful when editing 
large content classes.


 Usage
************

The extension adds a second button "Add attribute with Ajax" to the class/edit view, 
at the right of the "Add attribute" button.

Click on the "Add attribute with Ajax" button to add a new class attribute of the selected datatype.

There's also a second row of "up" and "down" buttons for each class attribute. Use these buttons 
to reorder class attributes by using Ajax.
